About pyRT_DISORT
=================

What it is
----------
pyRT_DISORT is a lightweight collection of algorithms designed to help make
the inputs for the DISORT algorithm. These functions and classes are designed
to seamlessly integrate with the numpy/scipy ecosystem, allowing the user to
quickly and efficiently create a radiative transfer model.

Papers using pyRT_DISORT
------------------------
* `Another one derives the dust: Ultraviolet dust aerosol properties retrieved
  from MAVEN/IUVS data <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115177>`_
* Upcoming Mastcam-Z paper
* Upcoming IUVS paper

If you use this code in your research, please consider acknowledging the use of
this package in your paper. If you don't that's fine too, though it would be
nice to add your work to the known papers pyRT_DISORT helped create.
