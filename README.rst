pyRT_DISORT
===========
pyRT_DISORT is a Python package that creates inputs to the the DISORT core
radiative transfer algorithm. It is now a companion repository to `pyDISORT
<https://github.com/kconnour/pyDISORT>`_ (pyDISORT contains the code to create
the binarized version of DISORT whereas pyRT_DISORT is a project to simply
create many of the arrays and constants required by DISORT).

The best way to get started with pyRT_DISORT is to check out the
`documentation <https://kconnour.github.io/pyRT_DISORT/>`_.
