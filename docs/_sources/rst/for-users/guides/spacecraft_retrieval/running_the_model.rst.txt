Running the model
=================
We have all the variables we need to simulate some reflectance curves. Recall
that we've been making properties (where applicable) at all 5 wavelengths at
once. Unfortunately DISORT can't natively handle this, so we need to loop over
wavelength. I'll import the necessary module and create an array that'll be
filled as DISORT runs.

.. code-block:: python

   import disort

   test_run = np.zeros(pixel_wavelengths.shape)

Once we carefully put all ~50 variables in the correct order and remember to
only select parts of the arrays we need (slicing off the wavelength dimension),
we can do simulations.

.. code-block:: python

   for ind in range(pixel_wavelengths.size):
       rfldir, rfldn, flup, dfdt, uavg, uu, albmed, trnmed = \
           disort.disort(USRANG, USRTAU, IBCND, ONLYFL, PRNT, PLANK, LAMBER,
                         DELTAMPLUS, DO_PSEUDO_SPHERE, DTAUC[:, ind], SSALB[:, ind],
                         PMOM[:, :, ind], TEMPER, WVNMLO, WVNMHI,
                         UTAU, UMU0, PHI0, UMU, PHI, FBEAM, FISOT,
                         ALBEDO, BTEMP, TTEMP, TEMIS, EARTH_RADIUS, H_LYR, RHOQ, RHOU,
                         RHO_ACCURATE, BEMST, EMUST, ACCUR, HEADER, RFLDIR,
                         RFLDN, FLUP, DFDT, UAVG, UU, ALBMED, TRNMED)

       test_run[ind] = uu[0, 0, 0]

   print(test_run)

This prints :code:`[0.20444766 0.18252057 0.07527761 0.11988172 0.10403387]`.

.. note::
   It seems pretty tedious to me to have to put in all the variables in the
   proper order. At some point I may make a function/class that accepts
   instances of classes that you've already created and then extracts the
   proper variables from those class attributes. But I can only do so much at
   once.
